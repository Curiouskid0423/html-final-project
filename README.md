# Final Project for ML

### Notes

#### Data Preprocessing :rocket:

Many non-numeric features to be converted.

#### Training :rocket:

##### Baseline model (Try the following):

- **(Naive) linear regression**. One model.
Use this as initialization.
- **Linear Regression with Transform**: Fit the features to a k-degree polynomial of your choice.
3+ models.
- SVR: SVM with regression (I dont know if this work)

##### Novel attempts

Hyperparameter tuning open to discussion.

- Neural Net (3-layers)
- **Recurrent Neural Net**


#### Testing :rocket:


Validation proportion: 
- Training (80%) vs Validation (20%)
